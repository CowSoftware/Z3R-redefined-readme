## This is maintenance branch of the Zelda3 PC Port by [SNESREV](https://github.com/snesrev/zelda3)

The original project was abounded by the developer ever since so this branch is an attempt to add unfinsished changes and continue the project.

Tested and still builds acording to the wiki: https://github.com/snesrev/zelda3/wiki    

Original snesrev repo that has been fully commented, refer to the [base](https://github.com/xander-haj/z3c) for this new repo.

## Current changes    
      
- Fixed windscreen mode.

- You can now re-arrange the in game HUD while `ExtendedAspectRatio` is higher than 4:3, allowing HUD elements to be placed anywhere.

- Y,X,L,R Buttons now have individual Item Boxes in the HUD with button labels applied.

- New in-game settings menu, allows anything, except for aspect ratio, to be modified in real time, aspect ratio changes still require restart for now.

## Compromises

- When re-arrange HUD is enabled, the Magic Meter uses the same base outline for both the base and powered up state, this is because the `2` in the 1/2 above the bar shares a sprite tile with the left corner of the item box, will hopefully fix to use proper fixed graphic soon.
